1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?
   ⇒ var declares variables that can be changed and are accessible everywhere, let also declares variables that can be changed but are only accessible within their immediate code block (like an if statement or loop), and const declares variables that cannot be reassigned after they are first set, but their internal contents (if it's an object or array) can still be modified.

2. What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
   ⇒ forEach executes a function on each array element but returns undefined. map executes a function on each element and returns a new array with the results. filter returns a new array containing elements that pass a given test.

3. What are arrow functions in ES6?
   ⇒ Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions in ES6.

4. How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
   ⇒ Destructuring assignment allows unpacking values from arrays or objects into distinct variables.

5. Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
   ⇒ Template literals use backticks (`) and allow embedding expressions with ${}. They can create multi-line strings and are easier to read compared to traditional string concatenation with (+).
